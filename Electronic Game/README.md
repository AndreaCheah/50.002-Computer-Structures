## Introduction
Deeznotes is an electronic hardware game that follows the Piano Tiles concept and is coded using Lucid programming, challenging players to press the correct button corresponding to a lit "light block" as it falls down. The game features four difficulty levels, with the speed of the falling blocks increasing at each level to ramp up the challenge.
